# 3D Function Renderer

This project aims to build a 3D renderer for mathematical functions using Python3 and the Pygame library. The goal is to represent mathematical functions visually in a 3D space, projecting them onto a 2D screen. Since Pygame lacks native 3D rendering, the project will involve constructing 3D polygons, calculating their screen projections, and rendering them using Pygame.

## Installation (for Developers)

```bash
git clone git@github.com:stepan-antonyuk/3d-function-renderer.git
cd 3d-function-renderer
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements
```

## Run

```bash
python3 src/main.py
```
